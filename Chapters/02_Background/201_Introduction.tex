This chapter introduces the background on real-time quality assessment of \ac{UGV}, its efficient upload from mobile devices, and its distribution.
Furthermore, we discuss two types of content adaptation: adaptive video streaming and video composition.
Afterwards we present a discussion of existing work on quality assessment of \ac{UGV} in Section~\ref{sec:210_quality_assessment}, the live video upload from mobile devices in Section~\ref{sec:220_videoupload}, video composition in Section~\ref{sec:240_videocomposition} and adaptive video streaming in Section~\ref{sec:250_background_content_aware_delivery}.
The following subsection highlights background information on digital video streaming and the understanding of the scenario discussed in this thesis.
